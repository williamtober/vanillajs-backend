# NodeJS Backend Boilerplate
This is just for fun so that I can tinker with various technologies and see how they integrated with nodejs. i.e. aws, firebase, mysql, mongo, etc etc.

## To Start
- install node lts
- run with ```node server.js```


## To Do
- lower level trycatch checking, at the moment the http instance starts listening.
- turn router into component
- implment full mvc model
- create different branches for one off backend services.
- create a react branch and have react public build used when a successful build is created.
